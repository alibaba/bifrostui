# Dark mode

Dark mode is an interface theme that uses black or dark tones as the dominant color scheme for the UI, providing users with a dark visual environment.

## When to use

-When working or reading for a long time in dim lighting conditions, turning on dark mode not only reduces the stimulation of screen brightness and alleviates eye fatigue caused by contrast, but also creates a more relaxed and comfortable usage environment, thereby optimizing the user's visual experience.

-For achieving an immersive focused state, dark mode is your ideal choice. It effectively directs attention to the highlighted content and key operations on the screen, similar to the practice of turning off lights at the beginning of a movie theater, ensuring that your vision and thinking are not disturbed by the surrounding environment and fully engaged in your work.

## Design principles

1. Comfort of Content\*\*

   Following the principle of comfort in design, high contrast colors and content should be used with caution in dark mode to prevent visual fatigue caused by prolonged use. Proper color matching and content contrast can enhance the comfort and durability of the user experience.

2. Consistency of Information\*\*

   Whether in dark or light mode, the presentation of information content should ensure consistency, maintain the original hierarchy and logical relationships, to avoid cognitive discontinuity caused by user interface switching. This continuity ensures a seamless user experience and enhances the intuitive use of the interface.

## color

In terms of color application, we use a basic color palette to allow colors to blend better in different environmental colors, reducing eye fatigue and meeting visual accessibility needs.
