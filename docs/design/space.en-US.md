# space

Space design is the core of systematic visual design, and its significant difference from traditional graphic design lies in its dynamism and systematization. The layout of the UI interface should not only consider static arrangement and combination, but also start from the evolution of user interaction and the overall visual architecture. Under the premise of following unified standards, BUI2 has established a complete interface layout system, providing designers with a logical and aesthetically pleasing platform for building layout spaces.
