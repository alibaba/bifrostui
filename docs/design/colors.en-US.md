# color

BUI's design philosophy is rooted in color construction from a product level perspective, which means that in meticulous design practice, we deeply explore the unique charm of each product and customize an exclusive color system that matches the product's temperament and functional requirements. Through this approach, BUI2 is committed to creating expressive and meaningful visual experiences, ensuring that color usage is not only aesthetically pleasing, but also strategic and purposeful.

## Color Model

BUI's design team has chosen the HSB color model as the color matching basis for their design, which endows designers with clear predictive ability during the color tuning process, ensuring that color selection is both intuitive and accurate. This model not only improves personal design efficiency, but also promotes smooth communication and collaboration among team members, thus doubling efficiency in achieving a common visual language.
