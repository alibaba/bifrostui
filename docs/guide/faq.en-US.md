# common problem

## Is it necessary to use webpack to 5. x when using BUI

Yes, some BUI components rely on webpack 5's exports syntax support for implementation.

## Do I have to use Taro to use BUI for mini programs

Yes, Taro is a very excellent cross end framework. Based on Taro, we can use React to develop BUI component libraries

## The difference between BUI and TaroUI

BUI is built on React and does not require the introduction of the Taro framework, making it more cost-effective to get started
